# Pairs-Trading
Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that involves identifying two assets (usually stocks) that have a high correlation. The core idea is to exploit temporary deviations from their historical price relationship by trading the pair, with the expectation that the prices will revert to their mean over time.

In this project, the pairs trading strategy is implemented in Python, on stocks selected from Yahoo Finance.
